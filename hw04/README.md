# hw04

mmap

The pdf file is the memory map of BeagleBone. 

For part 1, I used two buttons at GPIO_49 and GPIO_113. GPIO_113 controls the LED at USR2 and GPIO_49 controls the LED at USR3. Both LEDs are internal LED. 

For part 2, I modified gpioThru.c so the button at GPIO_49 will be used to toggle the LED at USR2. 

Etch-A-Sketch

Two encoders are added. Encoder_2 controls the x position and encoder_3 controls the y position. The other features (clean by button and high temperature) are preserved from hw03.
